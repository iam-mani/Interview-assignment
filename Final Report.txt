Dear Madam,

I am pleased to submit my work report, which includes a summary of the tasks assigned to me, along with the methods and tools I utilized to complete them.

Upon carefully reviewing the instructions you provided, I understood that I needed to accomplish the following tasks:
  1.Utilize the open-source code from the Sock Shop project.
  2.Conduct TDD and integration testing.
  3.Deploy the project using Docker, and subsequently perform integration testing.

To begin, I downloaded the Sock Shop project and executed it on my local server. I conducted manual integration testing and identified the absence of several documents, including docs.html, quickstart.html, and api.html.

Since manually checking each link was a tedious task, I employed automated testing processes. To do so, I used Python to scrape the original website for every link. I have included the scraping.ipynb file on my GitHub page for your perusal.

I also utilized the TDD - Test Driven Development method Red-Green-Refactoring method, which involved identifying bugs, rewriting the code, and refactoring it into my local server. I followed this process to address the missing docs.html, quickstart.html, and api.html documents, as well as correcting a CSS file mapping issue in index.html.

After implementing both manual and automated integration testing, I successfully developed a bug-free website. Your provided guidance links proved extremely useful in completing this task.

Next, I deployed the website using the Docker process.
  a) Firstly, I created an image using the command "docker build -t htmlapp:0.1." 
  b)I then verified that the image had been successfully created using the command "docker image ls."
  c)I proceeded to create a container with the command "docker container run -d --name htmlapp -p 8080:8080 htmlapp:0.1." 
  d)Finally, I checked the status of the container by utilizing "docker container ps," and confirmed that the website was successfully deployed and accessible at the local IP address 127.0.0.1:8080.

Finally, I have submitted my entire code on GitHub and have sent you an email with my work report attached for your review.

Thank you for the opportunity to complete this assignment.

Sincerely,
[Manikandan R]
